## Trust-Minimization

Bitcoin is a system first, not a cryptocurrency. The currency is a part of the system, not the system itself. The most important aspect of any currency is the system on which it relies. We have come to trust government-issued currency, for example, because it is familiar but also because we implicitly believe in the accountability of our political process to honor the currency we earn to tender our debts.

If faith in our political system deteriorates, so eventually will the value of its currency. Faith in Bitcoin's system is faith in similar ideas of familiarity and accountability that govern our reliance on political systems. The community however does not rely on or trust any one person or policy. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a system of [mathematical primitives](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1){:target="_blank"} and [peer network consensus](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#term-consensus-rules){:target="_blank"} for both issuance of the currency and for monetary policy.

This allows the system to be exceptionally uncorrelated to the policies and even the volatility of other monetary systems. Resultantly, Bitcoin achieves a third phenomenon unheard of in the history of finance: decentralization by way of [trust-minimization](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html){:target="_blank"}.


Trust-minimization pays homage to rules-based systems and not systems based on rulers. There are different ways to arrive at a rules-based system but proof of conclusion, or a rule executed, is fundamental. In Bitcoin, the [computationally-expensive process](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/555.pdf){:target="_blank"} to "proof of conclusion" is the first principle. A cryptocurrency that prioritizes anything but security will fail at securing what it is prioritizing. The security-for-performance tradeoff is an oldie but goodie in software development. Tech companies in particular are fashionably known for addressing scalability and security issues post-production, prioritizing growth and working out kinks along the way.

Unfortunately, this is bad for protocols.

A holder's faith in Bitcoin is not simplistic faith in the price increasing based on the frenetic adoption of new buyers who see the price increasing. Faith in Bitcoin is faith in the primarily rules-based system's ability to achieve consensus without any [trusted third-party](http://fortune.com/2017/08/31/wells-fargo-fake-accounts-scandal-2017-tim-sloan/){:target="_blank"}. This obliterates the potential for corruption, theft, and seizure of assets from the system, as there is no powerful person to buy off or single server to confiscate. When we hear in polite society "trust the system!" we should hear "trust them, they can enforce this or that outcome," with the unspoken disclaimer 'especially if it benefits the system.' Trust-minimized systems do not assume people are corrupt, simply that they can be, and design technical solutions that make corruption improbable.
