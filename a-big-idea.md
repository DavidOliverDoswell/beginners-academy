## A Big Idea

I believe it is technologically feasible to create a passive income architecture with Bitcoin. I imagine this as the market-based solution to a more political Universal Basic Income.

American households could participate in solar-powered mining pools owned by residents and the city. Residents would have mobile wallets like today except with mining data and controls for adjusting everything from energy expenditure to what pools have the best rates. States would compete to see who has the greenest and most profitable pools for bragging rights and tax incentives.

It may also be a non-controversial path to [renewable energy infrastructure investment](https://coincenter.org/entry/how-bitcoin-could-drive-the-clean-energy-revolution){:target="_blank"}.

The foundation is to continue building the family home on the consumer appliance. I believe the 21st century appliance boom should be [energy-efficient, plug-and-play Bitcoin nodes](http://bitseed.org){:target="_blank"}, [elegant mining hardware](https://halongmining.com){:target="_blank"}, and even [small satellites](https://blockstream.com/satellite/){:target="_blank"} for neighborhoods, as modems, routers and electrical grids were in the 20th century.

This would not only prove politically popular with constituents but also with politicians.

Such an architecture would allow for some insight into how consumers are earning bitcoins but not necessarily what they're doing with them. **If you're new to this blog, you should know I do not personally support government surveillance, intervention or unnecessary regulation. I mention the State participating at the local level only as a potential scalable outcome**.

A privacy option to participate in public mining and not share in tax incentives is only a slightly better market solution but could be provided.

Another argument would be on the modernity of government. Young people (people, generally, I would contest) perceive the State as ineffectual, timid and out-of-touch. A focus on the family and their direct prosperity graphically aligns with a politician's public morality.

American households would learn not only the value of creating wealth as a family but what it means to be one with your neighbors. There is a common conversation in America which is indirectly scaling financial literacy. This can be done from any home or apartment, whether single or married, as energy expenditure from the right product would be low and ultimately paid for by energy consumed from the sun, further distilled and offered by the city. You just need the appliances.

Families may mine Bitcoin on autopilot for shares of the [block reward](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/){:target="_blank"} without relying on petroleum as an energy source.

Payment routing as another income stream has even more potential, with [little configuration and no daily effort](https://lightning.engineering){:target="_blank"}. Lightning Network nodes may route payments as banks do today. There was more configuration setting up my mother's [Roku](https://www.roku.com/index) than there is setting up a [Lightning full node and wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhpg_8D2FPI).

As running a full node is incentivized, the cost for running a node is absorbed in the fees earned with any residual income as profit for the server.

Imagine commercials with a young girl on her mother's lap pointing at the screen asking questions about the family's mining and banking operations. Ambitious politicians arguing today for basic income as a safety net could campaign on the rhetoric of building American wealth to end poverty.

This would be intoxicating to constituents but this time within a voter's arm's reach.

Retail banking should migrate to the family household. Much of what is performed by banking institutions with databases and extraneous fee structures may be automated and captured by the family investor.

A decentralized network of computers verifying the transactions for millions of people around the world already exists, successfully, with Bitcoin.

A decentralized financial system, with the option to share data with interested parties, is a confident first step toward something resembling a universal basic income, without further mismanaging privacy or the tax code.
