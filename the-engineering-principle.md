## The Engineering Principle

Technical work is a thankless job. In the film and television industries, for example, the crew vastly outnumbers the people we see on screen. Yet few members of the audience attend a film to appreciate the precision of makeup applied to an actor or the impeccable lighting of a scene. A discriminating fewer more attend to watch the director think or listen to the writer make rhyme and reason. The vast majority have come to be entertained.

Consequently, the final product is a luxurious abstraction. Impurities are removed. Much of what was shot is left, as is said, "on the cutting room floor." The gorgeous often hyper-productized result is a transmogrified grotesque. Technical people know products only look as good as they work. This is the job of the critic: to parse and judge what the audience cannot to arrive at a standard for making what the audience wants. This is completely different in Bitcoin, where the pubic isn't hidden from the process but rather encouraged to participate in the production.

Bitcoin is open source software with a [well-documented process](https://bitcoincore.org){:target="_blank"} of how it arrives at its standards. Bitcoin is not a company. Bitcoin is not a product. There is no marketing department or holiday sales. There is no charismatic authority or even a real consumer interface.

Can it ever arrive at something for the general public who chooses not to participate? [Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhpg_8D2FPI){:target="_blank"}. [Indeed](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/){:target="_blank"}.

For now, Bitcoin does generate free Bitcoin addresses, on or offline, for every man, woman and child, on planet earth. Software wallets that generate [mnemonic phrases](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase){:target="_blank"} with addresses allow users to backup and restore wallets from any device without knowing the exact number and letter sequence of their private keys. These recovery seeds further allow untrusted third-party systems to generate addresses without the ability to spend any bitcoins associated with these addresses.

This functionality is freely available to every man, woman and child, on planet earth.

Bitcoin does use checksums to prevent typographical errors that may occur if your mother accidentally tries to send bitcoins to an address that does not exist. Bitcoin does have smart contracts known as [P2SH (Pay to script hash)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash){:target="_blank"}, which allows a user to send Bitcoin transactions to a script without knowing the condition(s) the recipient has set up to redeem the coins in the script. The recipient must provide a script matching the script that was sent and data which makes the script evaluate to true.

A married or committed couple may have a type of secure joint-account, what is called a [multi-signature](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature){:target="_blank"} ("multisig") Bitcoin address, where the conditions might be such that one cannot spend bitcoins from the address without the permission of them both.

This functionality is freely available to every man, woman and child, on planet earth. The technical talent of the Bitcoin community is no trivial thing. Some of the world's most talented cryptographers, scientists, engineers, many of whom have created the [systems](https://blockstream.com/team/christopher-allen/){:target="_blank"} and [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Russell){:target="_blank"} your company likely uses today, are contributors to Bitcoin.

They are also volunteers, ensuring the price of Bitcoin is the least interesting thing about it while also being the second most undervalued.
