3. "Knowledge of the long history of non-governmental money was one of the inspirations of the original invention of trust-minimized cryptocurrency."

11. "In the industrial revolution, factories had to attract workers with frequent pay that could be spent at bargain shops."

12. "The Royal Mint was not producing low-denomination coins, so factories minted their own or used the coins minted by another firm."
