## The Final Problem

#### David Oliver Doswell

To be fair, I have not read Instagram's fine print. Like you, I am near certain that it says, in so many words, that if I try and take them to court for illegal use of a photo to which I claim ownership I have no right. By using Instagram, I implicitly (and explicitly through their Terms of Service) have said, in so many words, that my images are not my own. I am fine with this because I presumably find more value in sharing the photo than owning it.

This is the consumer internet. Digital objects I create on private platforms are not my own. This is a fair exchange if less than ideal. There is no one forcing me to use these services. I am free to post updates to my life and connect with far-away strangers, friends and family, in exchange for my documents, videos and family photos existing effectively as private property on these platforms.

The problem is someone can copy my Instagram photos, pass them off as their own, and sell them for a profit, even while Instagram "owns them." They can do further damage if they bypass the security that is supposed to only show my account to people I approve and expose my photos to people of whom I do not approve, such as a crazy ex-lover or political oppressor.

There is no uniqueness of digital objects let alone accountability of possession in software. Even trusted third-parties [cannot always be trusted](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do){:target="_blank"}. How can anyone earn a living being creative let alone manage a large enterprise business on the internet with no security or uniqueness? A photo or any unique digital object is worthless if someone else can present and say they possess the original copy.

This is the Final Problem.

The solution is rather obvious today: decentralize trust and organization, and incentivize a network of accountability based on game theory, math and [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography){:target="_blank"}. Obviously. Bitcoin solves this Problem. Bitcoin is a distributed computer network that simply verifies the state of an intrinsic ledger of accountability without a trusted third-party. This ledger is a collection of events that have occurred, namely financial transactions between two or more individuals or machines.

This computer network is decentralized. These computers are voluntary individuals (or pools of individuals in the case of mining) running the Bitcoin software. [Miners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp){:target="_blank"} run the software for profit and do so independent of the personal or monetary needs of the ecosystem. [Nodes](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node){:target="_blank"} run the software to enforce the consensus rules of the computer network and to authenticate their own transaction data without a trusted third-party, such as a miner or cryptocurrency exchange.

So what problem did Bitcoin specifically solve? The answer is the value of software irreplicability. We discussed that if I send you a document, a YouTube video or a cat photo, that it is merely a copy of the original. While the original copy exists in my possession, there is nothing stopping me from sending a copy to someone else. There is also nothing stopping you from sending a copy to someone else and passing it off as the original. Sufficient technical skills would even allow you to modify the timestamp of the document, video or photo, and any other data associated with it.

This makes the digital object in question ephemeral, which is in part why we prioritize the authorship of objects on the internet, not the value of them. What makes some _thing_ valuable on the internet is the same as what makes something valuable in real life: [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity){:target="_blank"}.

The Bitcoin network has a hard cap of 21 million coins to be mined every 10 minutes. These scarce digital objects cannot be replicated. The mining process is the only way new bitcoins are created. There is no other way to create new coins. You can earn them, buy them, be gifted them, or even steal them from unsuspecting persons or machines, but they can only be created honestly.

The computer network achieves consensus by rejecting any person or machine that would attempt to increase or decrease the 21 million cap, or any person or machine attempting to create new coins without submitting the [agreed upon information](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference){:target="_blank"} to be included in each new block of transactions.

This is how scarcity and security (and thus value) are achieved on the Bitcoin computer network.

The miners and nodes function as checkpoints of accountability to ensure that the network as a whole enforces the technical and consensus parameters. Traditionally, someone was needed to be in charge of managing who owns each valuable object at any given time (such as a bank). If valuable objects are traded, bought or sold frequently (such as currencies), someone further was needed to manage how another person acquires them, when another person has them, etc.

Bitcoin's codebase provides a [built-in incentive](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/){:target="_blank"} for miners to maintain the integrity and sequence of blocks on the computer network. This in part is what prevents replicability. This is also what allows the computer network to be decentralized. The current reward for miners who discover and broadcast new blocks to be added to Bitcoin's intrinsic ledger (blockchain) is 12.5 bitcoins ($145,277.56 USD + fees).

If a miner attempts to add 15 bitcoins or 12.3 bitcoins to their block when they broadcast it, that block will be rejected. The computer network ensures no one can counterfeit blocks or coins, or ownership of coins, at any given time. This is notably achieved without the need for any one person or machine to have control over this process.

This process and computer network together is called [Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
