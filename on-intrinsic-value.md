This is a great introduction on Bitcoin as [sound money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukjDCeuNK3Y){:target="_blank"}.

One of the economic definitions we use in Bitcoin regarding sound money is [Bitcoin's deflationary monetary policy](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/5/#selection-51.0-65.17){:target="_blank"}.

This was a [design constraint](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html){:target="_blank"} of creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

Essentially, Bitcoin has a fixed supply limit of coins to be mined and new coins may only be created honestly through the mining process, on an algorithmic schedule. The value of each coin increases over time, as well, [as this limit is met](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/block-reward-halving-a-guide-1354053560/){:target="_blank"}.

Consequently, there will be some speculative mania as more people seek to acquire new coins faster than the system can supply them. As with any asset, a part of the value of each coin is based on demand.
