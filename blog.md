## The Property Analogy
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 18, 2017

Bitcoin is often discussed in the context of money because of the unit of account miners create during the [mining process](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp){:target="_blank"}. This unit of account is a portable, fungible, divisible, incorruptible, if expensive, medium of exchange, but may be used as a store of value. There are reasons for this function. Bitcoin's development methodology and by extension its blockchain [prioritizes security](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation){:target="_blank"}. This means the community culture prioritizes security, demonstrated in Bitcoin's obstinance to be the faster, cheaper blockchain. The truncated blocksize debate aside, there is real success here to this production. Bitcoin managed to create the most valuable digital real estate on the planet. Let us briefly discuss why Bitcoin as a medium of exchange or store of value belies the real value of the right to own property simply by individual choice and monetary decree.

First, to say "I have bitcoins" is something of a misnomer. What you have is access to an address in a database. The database stores data made up of [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit){:target="_blank"} that may be equated and denominated into something resembling money. This is similar to how your local bank denominates the data in your checking account, which are also computer bits in their database. For security reasons, a bank rarely keeps tens of millions of paper dollars at your corner branch for its patrons. In fact, money today is [nothing more than an entry in a database](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-history-of-the-gold-standard-3306136).

The most valuable money it would stand to reason should be the money whose database is the most secure. How is security measured? In computer systems, they are measured by their [uptime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime), [latency](https://www.lifewire.com/latency-on-computer-networks-818119), [resiliency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilient_control_systems), among many other things. The net result is a system on which we can rely. Now, design the system or computer program with a finite amount of space for storing data. The economic principle says the data in that space would be as valuable as it is scarce, and of increasing interest to interested parties. The data itself may even become increasingly valuable over time assuming the improvement of the system. This is not dissimilar to how we understand ownership of property.

A finite amount of property exists in any given space. Assuming improvement of the surrounding environment, the property within the space may enjoy an increase in value simply because of its location. If said property itself were useful to an interested party, the property may enjoy manifold returns in value for its location to an improving environment and for its usefulness. Imagine owning a small piece of property on Park Avenue in Manhattan circa 1870.

The railroad tracks on Fourth Avenue were first being covered over by pavement to make way for pedestrians and brownstones. Now imagine living long enough to see The Waldorf Astoria, UBS, The Harold Pratt House, and 432 Penthouse go up. Your small property would be worth a large fortune. The surrounding environment of New York City saw unparalleled investment in business infrastructure over the next 147 years. Finally, the utility of what you built in those days would likely be outmoded, today. But you would have refreshing optionality to sell or even rent your property. Bitcoin's database benefits from being a technology, meaning it is prime location to an improving surrounding environment, in this case the technology industry. What gets built on this property will be new, diverse, kaleidoscopic, but at the discretion of those who have an address.


## Trust-Minimization
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 16, 2017


Bitcoin is a system first, not a cryptocurrency. The currency is a part of the system, not the system itself. The most important aspect of any currency is the system on which it relies. We have come to trust government-issued currency, for example, because it is familiar but also because we implicitly believe in the accountability of our political process to honor the currency we earn to tender our debts.

If faith in our political system deteriorates, so eventually will the value of its currency. Faith in Bitcoin's system is faith in similar ideas of familiarity and accountability that govern our reliance on our political system. However, the Bitcoin community does not rely on or trust any one person or policy. Instead, the community relies on a system of mathematical primitives and peer network consensus for both issuance of the currency and for monetary policy. This allows the system to be exceptionally uncorrelated to the policies, peer networks, and volatility of other monetary systems, digital or industrial. Resultantly, Bitcoin achieves a third phenomenon unheard of in the history of finance: decentralization. This is where the system distributes trust to improve accountability. We call this [trust-minimization](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html).


Trust-minimization means a more open and transparent financial system. [Computationally-expensive processes](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/555.pdf) to achieve an immutable, censorship-resistant store of value is the first principle of any cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency that prioritizes anything but security will fail at securing what it is prioritizing. This security-for-performance tradeoff is a constant in software development. Tech companies are fashionably known for addressing scalability and security issues post-production, prioritizing growth and working out kinks along the way. Unfortunately, this is bad for protocols.

Bitcoin prioritizes security over performance, though it is arguably [the most performant database on the planet](http://bitcoinuptime.com). Consequently, the system is far and away the most trusted cryptocurrency implementation by institutional investors, who continue to pour billions into both [futures contracts](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/15/bitcoin-futures-are-about-to-get-another-big-boost.html) and [personal investments](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-10/bitcoin-is-no-bubble-says-investor-with-213-million-stake). But why? Isn't trust the bedrock of every financial system, especially at the institutional level? Indeed. Bitcoin is not "trust-less." It is trust-minimized. Here that means, it is not who you trust but what. Our faith is literally in the system. The upside is trust is distributed and thus scalable, which conveniently means corruption is not. Incorruptible financial systems should be highly valued.

Faith in Bitcoin is not simplistic faith in the price increasing based on the frenetic adoption of new buyers who see the price increasing. Faith in Bitcoin is faith in the system's ability to achieve consensus without any [trusted third-party](http://fortune.com/2017/08/31/wells-fargo-fake-accounts-scandal-2017-tim-sloan/). This obliterates the potential for corruption, theft, and seizure of assets from the system, as there is no powerful person to buy off or single server to confiscate. When we hear "trust the system" in other processes, we should hear "trust me, I can enforce this or that outcome, if it benefits the system... or me." Trust-minimized systems do not assume people are corrupt, simply that they can be, and design technical solutions that make corruption improbable.


## The Engineering Principle

##### December 12, 2017


Technical work is a thankless job. In the film and television industries, the crew is literally called below-the-line talent. Few members of the audience attend a screening of a film to appreciate the makeup on an actor or the lighting of a scene. A discriminating fewer more attend to watch the director think or listen to the writer make rhyme and reason. The vast majority have come to be entertained. Consequently, the final product is a luxurious abstraction. Impurities are removed. Much of what is shot is left, as is said in the industry, "on the cutting room floor." The gorgeous often hyper productized result is a transmogrified grotesque. Technical people know products only look as good as they work. No more is this true than in Bitcoin.

The original and most successful peer-to-peer network with a simple accountability mechanism to achieve consensus has no marketing department. Bitcoin does not have commercials or holiday sales. Bitcoin does not have a PR guy or even a real consumer interface.

Bitcoin does generate free Bitcoin addresses, on or offline, for every man, woman and child, on planet earth. Bitcoin does offer a deterministic software wallet that generates "seed tokens," allowing users to backup and restore wallets from any device without knowing the exact number and letter sequence of their private keys. These recovery seeds further allow untrusted third-party systems to generate addresses without the ability to spend any bitcoins associated with these addresses. This functionality is freely available to every man, woman and child, on planet earth.

Bitcoin does use checksums to prevent typographical errors that may occur if your mother accidentally tries to send bitcoins to an address that does not exist. Bitcoin does have smart contracts known as P2SH (Pay to script hash), which allows a user to send Bitcoin transactions to a script without knowing the condition(s) the recipient has set up to redeem the coins in the script. The recipient must provide a script matching the script that was sent and data which makes the script evaluate to true. A married or committed couple may have a type of secure joint-account, what is called a multi-signature ("multisig") Bitcoin address, where the conditions might be such that one cannot spend bitcoins from the address without the permission of them both.

This functionality is freely available to every man, woman and child, on planet earth. The technical talent of the Bitcoin community is no trivial thing. Some of the world's most talented cryptographers, scientists, engineers, many of whom have created the [systems](https://blockstream.com/team/christopher-allen/) and [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Russell) your company likely uses today, are contributors to Bitcoin. They are also volunteers. They are quiet and working, ensuring the price of Bitcoin is the least interesting thing about it while also being the second most undervalued.


## The Mania of Poverty
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 8, 2017


The blood euphoria of making money speculating on the value of a currency is usually the domain of day traders. Most people are simply unacquainted with having money with which to speculate. People work for money, spend the money they made working, and do it all over again the next day. It has become a miserable and fascinating turn of events. The financial system has gambled with the people's pensions, investments, all with the expectation that the government will pay for their losses. The lack of scarcity in money has made money worthless no matter how much it costs. A putrid old system of pseudo-druids and lenders, the financial institution is clumsily surprised by the working public's interest in a financial asset they own and control.

While retail investors panic buying on exchanges continues to worry institutional investors, CNBC, and a [prize-winning economist](http://fortune.com/2017/11/30/economist-joseph-stiglitz-bitcoin-should-be-outlawed/) or [two](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/16/nobel-winning-economist-shiller-calls-bitcoin-a-fad.html), new investors who work day jobs as single parents expecting [maybe 5%](http://www.interest.com/401k/news/kind-return-expect-401k-plans/) returns on their 401K are learning the real value of money. Bitcoin teaches you the value of money, not the utility. Sure, sending money from one person to another using Bitcoin's immutable accountability ledger ([proof-of-work chain](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/11/), or "blockchain") works as promised. It's worked everyday, 24 hours a day, [without fail](http://bitcoinuptime.com), for almost 9 years. But one of its more attractive qualities is its open utility. To buy and hold Bitcoin, you simply need a willingness to learn, a humble heart, and the cost of even a fraction of a Bitcoin, as little as $5.00. To become an [accredited](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp) investor, you need a million dollar net worth, or an annual income of $200,000 - $300,000 for at least two years, even if you're technically unqualified.

There are other extraneous qualifications the SEC may invoke to consider you sophisticated enough to know if cartoon dog ears on your social media profile picture is a valuable feature to teenagers. Sophistication is debatable, and many accredited investors have argued this rule to be outdated. Crytpocurrencies, generally, regardless of the technology (or lack thereof) underpinning them, are a new asset class for the unsophisticated. Yes, the potential here is an honest market where the value of money is not how often you spend it but how difficult it is for you to part with it. However, it is also about giving regular people the glowing opportunity to learn how to become financially independent, by freely purchasing an asset on an open market without intrusion of a lender or a trusted third-party.


## On Intrinsic Value
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 7, 2017


Millennials are very interested in economic freedom. They actually [prefer this to a good job](https://www.npr.org/2016/09/26/495487260/millennials-want-to-be-entrepreneurs-but-a-tough-economy-stands-in-their-way). However, few of them have a savings account let alone own any financial assets. The reason is [most Americans are financially illiterate](http://fortune.com/2016/07/12/financial-literacy/). Until recently I was no different. Plainly, financial independence may only be achieved by understanding the principles of money. And the best money is sound money. What do Bitcoiners mean by "sound money?" And how is Bitcoin sound in a digital world of infinite copies of digital objects?

One of the economic definitions we use in Bitcoin regarding sound money is [Bitcoin's deflationary monetary policy](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/5/#selection-51.0-65.17). The amount of coins is capped at 21 million. This was a [design constraint](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html) of the creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Essentially, Bitcoin has a fixed supply limit of coins to be mined and new coins may only be created honestly through the mining process on an algorithmic schedule. The value of each coin increases over time as this limit relinquishes and as more people seek to acquire new coins faster than the system can supply them. As with any asset, the value of each coin is based on demand. The demand is based on the technology, engineering talent, and consensus algorithm that makes Bitcoin's currency (bitcoins) secure and unique.

In this way Bitcoin's "utility" is its intrinsic value: a secure and unique digital asset that no person or machine can seize or manipulate from the system. While centralized exchanges and banks branding themselves as secure may get hacked, or become in some manner compromised, this has never happened on the Bitcoin network. The world's most [sophisticated hackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c7lzi/i_tried_to_hack_bitcoin_and_failed_dan_kaminsky/) over the years have tried. This value proposition as a borderless, censorship-resistant, decentralized and immutable means of communication makes the system invaluable. Logically this makes any object intrinsically built into such a design equally valuable.

Thus the best investment strategy of such a rare, precious object would be to hold and protect it. Holders in Bitcoin have [optionality](https://www.quora.com/What-is-optionality-according-to-Nicholas-Nassim-Taleb) as the value continues to increase over time because the fundamentals of the monetary policy are warranted. A healthy flywheel effect emerges as holders (hodlers, a famous [misspelling in a blog post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)) benefit from thoughtful and conservative development of the object. As the object's value increases, so do outside interests and their money. As outside interest increases, so does the incentive for them to protect their new investment. This network effect in part makes bitcoins intrinsically valuable.


## The Final Problem
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 4, 2017


To be fair, I have not read Instagram's fine print. Like you, I am near certain that it says, in so many words, if I try and take them to court for illegal use of a photo to which I claim ownership I have no right. By using Instagram, I implicitly (and explicitly through their Terms of Service) have said, in so many words, that my images are not my own. I am fine with this because I presumably find more value in sharing the photo than owning it.

This is the consumer internet. Digital objects I create on private platforms are not my own. This is a fair exchange if less than ideal. There is no one forcing me to use these services. I am free to post updates to my life and connect with far-away strangers, friends and family, in exchange for my documents, videos and family photos existing effectively as private property on these platforms.

The problem is someone can copy my Instagram photos, pass them off as their own, and sell them for a profit, even while Instagram "owns them." They can do further damage if they bypass the security that is supposed to only show my account to people I approve and expose my photos to people of whom I do not approve, such as a crazy ex-lover or political oppressor.

There is no uniqueness of digital objects let alone accountability of possession in software. Even trusted third-parties [cannot always be trusted](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do). How can anyone earn a living being creative let alone manage a large enterprise business on the internet with no security or uniqueness? A photo or any unique digital object is worthless if someone else can present and say they possess the original copy.

This is the Final Problem.

The solution is rather obvious today: decentralize trust and organization, and incentivize a network of accountability based on game theory, math and [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography). Obviously. Bitcoin solves this Problem. Bitcoin is a distributed computer network that simply verifies the state of an intrinsic ledger of accountability without a trusted third-party. This ledger is a collection of events that have occurred, namely financial transactions between two or more individuals or machines.

This computer network is decentralized. These computers are voluntary individuals (or pools of individuals in the case of mining) running the Bitcoin software. [Miners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp) run the software for profit and do so independent of the personal or monetary needs of the ecosystem. [Nodes](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node) run the software to enforce the consensus rules of the computer network and to authenticate their own transaction data without a trusted third-party, such as a miner or cryptocurrency exchange.

So what problem did Bitcoin specifically solve? The answer is the value of software irreplicability. We discussed that if I send you a document, a YouTube video or a cat photo, that it is merely a copy of the original. While the original copy exists in my possession, there is nothing stopping me from sending a copy to someone else. There is also nothing stopping you from sending a copy to someone else and passing it off as the original. Sufficient technical skills would even allow you to modify the timestamp of the document, video or photo, and any other data associated with it.

This makes the digital object in question ephemeral, which is why we prioritize the authorship of objects on the internet, not the value of them. What makes some _thing_ valuable on the internet is the same as what makes something valuable in real life: [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity).

The Bitcoin network has a hard cap of 21 million coins to be mined every 10 minutes. This is the only way new bitcoins are created. There is no other way to create new coins. You can earn them, buy them, be gifted them, or even steal them from unsuspecting persons or machines, but they can only be created honestly. The computer network achieves consensus by rejecting any person or machine that would attempt to increase or decrease the 21 million cap, or any person or machine attempting to create new coins without submitting the [agreed upon information](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference) to be included in each new block of transactions.

This is how scarcity and security (and thus value) are achieved on the Bitcoin computer network. Individual bitcoins cannot be replicated without being mined and the finite number of them increase in value as more individual people accumulate them. This particular phenomenon is what is called a [network effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp).

The miners and nodes function as checkpoints of accountability to ensure that the network as a whole enforces the technical and consensus parameters. Traditionally, someone was needed to be in charge of managing who owns each valuable object at any given time (such as a bank). If valuable objects are traded, bought or sold frequently (such as currencies), someone further was needed to manage how another person acquires them, when another person has them, etc.

Bitcoin's codebase provides a built-in incentive for miners to maintain the integrity and sequence of blocks on the computer network. This in part is what prevents replicability. This is also what allows the computer network to be decentralized. The current reward for miners who discover and broadcast new blocks to be added to Bitcoin's intrinsic ledger (blockchain) is 12.5 bitcoins ($145,277.56 USD + fees).

If a miner attempts to add 15 bitcoins or 12.3 bitcoins to their block when they broadcast it, that block will be rejected. The computer network ensures no one can counterfeit blocks or coins, or ownership of coins, at any given time. This is notably achieved without the need for any one person or machine to have control over this process. This process and computer network together is called [Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).


## A Big Idea
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 3, 2017


The scientific innovation of the early 20th century was exceptional and paved the way for the burgeoning American research facilities, and large corporations, that would soon follow. Between 1945 and 1960, America's gross national product was up over [150%](http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/outlines/history-1994/postwar-america/the-postwar-economy-1945-1960.php). Services industries found post-industrial footing which complemented America's stalwart manufacturing sector. Automobiles and mortgages were abundant and affordable. Higher education was accessible to most Americans and college was less aspirational as a corollary to secondary school.

While the war created prosperity and technological innovation it also finished a new kind of society, and hand-crafted a new type of citizen in the process: The Consumer. By 1985, the [successful young American](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yuppie.asp) was a comfortably material-obsessed, ambitious employee of a large corporation. The businessman replaced the scientist as a beacon of progress. Deriving one's identity from personal possessions were common. Consumption was en vogue and Americans bulked up. Bud Paxson's The Home Shopping Network found a market for privileged stay-at-home moms and was turning a profit 3 months after going live on national television from a fledgling radio broadcast.

American ingenuity began fleeing the garages and sheds of would-be entrepreneurs only to be rediscovered in the research centers and innovation labs of corporate America. The inventor was an outlier and reliably scoffed at for their inventions. By 1995, the US was a bottom-line business culture of synthetic foods, cheap textiles, and "Made in China."

The construct of The Consumer has ballooned over the last 20 years. The successful young American of 2017 is overweight, overspent and underwhelmed by consumption. Subjective value theory has infected everything from politics to science, where what you believe to be true may be comfortably sold to you for a price. Some have argued that economics as a social science promotes a monetary policy that prioritizes spending over saving. Would that explain consumer debt markets?

"69% of Americans Have Less Than $1,000 in Savings," according to [Go Banking Rates](https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/data-americans-savings/), a popular personal finance resource. One solution is "pay for your losses" self-discipline: cut back, count pennies, waste not want not. This still works. But this has proven to be an insufficient method for society. For time constraints on this blogpost, it simply doesn't scale. Admonishing consumers to save is scolding lions to silence. It is counterintuitive and produces the opposite of the desired outcome. In America, rubbish political candidates, at best. At worst, conversations with your co-workers while sober.

Another solution is migrating the American citizen from Consumer to Participant. By this I mean, creating something resembling a modern hedge fund where average tax-paying citizens may be investing partners. Bitcoin is unique in polishing a reliable network of accountability with the agency to [distribute the state of the latest block](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) to whomever chooses to participate in the network. There is a precedent here. American households could participate in mining pools that expend computational resources to discover new blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. For a small fee, of course.

Families would learn not only the value of creating wealth as a family but what it means to be accountable to your neighbors. This also makes the question of 'Should we save or should we spend?' more predictable. Retail banking would (and should) move to the American household. A decentralized network of computers verifying the transactions of billions of people across the world successfully exists today with Bitcoin. A decentralized financial system with the option to share data with interested parties is a confident first step toward a universal basic income, without further mismanaging the tax code.


## The Modern Family
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 30, 2017


Steve Jobs had a simple vision: one day every family would own a personal computer. That vision came true. Today, most Western households own at least one desktop or laptop computer. Most also own an array of mobile pocket supercomputers, complete with high resolution graphics, sensing cameras, speech recognition; a virtual assistant; proximity, light and moisture sensors; a three-axis gyroscope, a barometer, and software with the response and reliability of any sophisticated modern machine.

While this does not come close to enumerating the specs of the iPhone, you get the point. We are far more tech savvy than we care to admit. The issue of late is how much our computer devices are savvy of us. I am specifically interested in the value they generate compared to the amount of real dollars we spend on them. The iPhone is an extraordinary device. Nonetheless, only the exceptionally tech savvy may build applications and make decent money with them.

I believe we have adopted a consumerist disposition to a creative medium. I question, why haven't these devices enhanced our ability to work less, buy less, and do more? Why are they not at a minimum generating a basic income for us to pay for their services, let alone our monthly debts and mortgages?

The question is equally sociological as economic. We were champion consumers throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The home appliances market exploded and many working-class families from around the world bought them. Most people prided themselves on how much stuff they owned. The internet's business model was bootstrapped with the same model that bootstrapped the television industry: advertising. Working-class families after a hard day's work discovered new products to purchase while being entertained by television programs. Sadly, the internet has become a shopping and entertainment portal not dissimilar to the legacy television networks.

However, this might be a transient state. I believe we can be weaned off of consumption and suckled on the fruits of our own production. The end result may not only be an increase in wealth but a reduction in the non-creative work necessary to generate it. I am talking about a more modern system capable of storing incorruptible monetary value whose currency is capable of instant machine-to-machine payments. I think you know where I am going with this illustration. The new home appliances revolution is about creating wealth for the family in addition to storing frozen food.

Just as nearly every working-class home over the last 20 years has purchased some form of internet-connected computer, I believe every home over the next 20 years should be a participant in a global financial system. In the 20 years since Jobs returned to Apple (1997) with a vision for how to rebuild a company on the brink of bankruptcy, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system emerged to do the same for the working-class family. Modems, routers and smartphones were the first wave yet required the advertising model to fund its creative outlet: the internet. Miners, routers ([Lightning Network](https://lightning.network) nodes on [Bitcoin Fibre](http://bitcoinfibre.org)) and Bitcoin wallets may be required to migrate the working-class family from consumers to shareholder.


## Personal Responsibility
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 29, 2017


As we migrate from consumer to equal partner in our new global financial system, there are some best practices you should be acquainted with going forward. First, never keep your bitcoins or any significant amount of fiat money (dollars, euros, yen, rubles, etc. ) on a cryptocurrency exchange. This is not because exchanges are unethical or incompetent. While this is certainly relevant to some exchanges these aren't the early days of Mt. Gox. Exchanges and what the community expects of them has dramatically improved. It is because exchanges are first and foremost centralized, and therefore easier to attack, litigate, or hold hostage.

Second, because Bitcoin is not about trusted third-parties managing your cryptocurrency. Your interface to Bitcoin so far has likely been through a third-party service, perhaps even one that holds the private keys to your coins. This is highly inadvisable. Letting someone else control your private keys means they say when and how you have access to your bitcoins.

Unfortunately this is common and obscures the reason why Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin's system of exchange (what inventor Satoshi Nakamoto called a "proof-of-work chain," also known as "blockchain,") is designed to be peer-to-peer, meaning between you and another person (or machine). Your interface to Bitcoin would be better understood with someone sending you bitcoins directly to a wallet where you own and control the private keys. I will discuss more of this and other best practices in later posts.

For now, if you do not have an approved Bitcoin wallet (one whose codebase is open source and may be peer reviewed, battle-tested and compared), check out [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) for recommended desktop, hardware and software wallets. I personally prefer Bitcoin Core (desktop), Trezor for my hardware wallet, and Green Address and Bread for mobile. However, you should choose what best serves your needs. Maybe it's Ledger Nano S for your hardware wallet and Airbitz for your software wallet. Regardless, all of these give you ownership of your private keys. Purchasing bitcoins from an exchange like Coinbase is fine, though more private options exist. Just make sure the moment you purchase bitcoins from Coinbase, or any exchange, you immediately send them to a wallet where you control the private keys. You are in control.


## On Antifragility
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 29, 2017


Systems as with people improve when they profit from information. But some information cannot be researched. One of life's annoying little lessons is that durable information may be only be acquired through experience. For a citizenry crudely optimized for efficiency this is not a welcome development. The process is uncivilized, error prone, and reductionist. But this is how we learn to be efficient in the absence of fantasy: experimentation.

Bitcoin is a trust-minimized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that gains from disorder. As a singularity the system is more organism than state machine and evolves somewhat similarly. Information propagates through the network by way of unit tests and attacks, price discovery and speculation, until it is battle-tested with nothing more than pure nature to kill it or make it stronger.
