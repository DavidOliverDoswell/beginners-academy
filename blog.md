## On Bitcoin and Free Banking
#### David Oliver Doswell

##### April 9, 2018


The Bitcoin blockchain is the most advanced, battle-tested database in production. It is the only immutable record of history in the world, a global supercomputer ensuring no participating actor may cheat the system, forge a signature, or steal any units of account.

It is more deeply an information system of [secure property with owner authority](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/){:target="_blank"}, a socially scalable identity system.

This system is not easily subjected to hard forking its core protocol because of market demand. Bitcoin is not a company, a product, or a service (barring conventional uses of the word "service"). The system is not hierarchical, centralized, or expedient.

Any person or organization may participate in the system and be equal to every other person or organization in the system, were they willing to contribute the same amount of value of said persons or organizations.

There is something, too, uniquely relevant to the timing of the invention.

Bitcoin is a not democracy and is not designed to improve the current political or financial system.

Bitcoin is cryptoanarchy: a political ideology that believes that messages and transactions over insecure public networks, such as the internet, should be protected by strong cryptographic primitives, holding true that individuals are sovereign and should make decisions based on what's best for them and not the group.

It is an honest and practical view of the world. Most humans [practice it everyday](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prisoners-dilemma){:target="_blank"}, if unwittingly.

People would prefer more privacy than less. People would prefer of their own volition to selectively reveal and articulate themselves to the world.

People should, too, then have the respect of being addressed and appropriated based on their requests. These ideas, while free-thinking and info-modern, maximize trust in the individual and minimize the necessity to trust in others.

It is counterintuitive but this is what strengthens a system and the relationships between individuals within a system over time.

Strong people enforce strong realities and have the capacity to maintain strong relationships. The transition from dependence on trusted-third parties to decentralized crypto-systems maintained by strong participating actors is a work in progress.

Systems are, after all, easier to design than psychologies. However, better systems are required.

Education, mentorship, and good design (better defaults in software and hardware development) are antecedents to this physical pro-form. Bitcoin is the foundational reality of this new digital epoch. Here's why:

January 2017 saw the beginning of the end of public banking. The [ICO ("initial coin offering")](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/ico-explained){:target="_blank"} boom year saw public blockchain experiments [financing their crowdsourced crypto projects with bitcoins](https://www.tezos.com/help){:target="_blank"}.

[Ethereum itself was an ICO](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/){:target="_blank"} and raised capital using bitcoins, maybe the most successful ICO project to date. Ethereum is now the leading platform for building cryptocurrency applications. Contrary to many of my contemporaries, I think this is good for Bitcoin.

Private and free banking is how markets are supposed to work. The market should decide what money is at any time during a private transaction. If I prefer your shirt, for example, to your government-issued money, your cryptocurrency token, or your shiny gold ETF certificate, that should suffice.

Public and private blockchain experiments, however ambitious, criminal, or sophomoric, are positive examples of free banking. Historical precedents for similar realities have been documented, namely during the Industrial Revolution in Britain.

In the mid 1640s, Charles I of England, who believed in the "divine right of kings," [confiscated 130,000 pounds of silver bullion from the Royal Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England){:target="_blank"}, calling it "a loan" at 8%.

Although returned, goldsmiths were spooked and began withdrawing their gold from the Royal Mint out of fear of future confiscation. Goldsmiths immediately began storing gold in their personal coffers inside private warehouses in London.

Holders of gold, too, were satisfied and could easily deposit their gold with a goldsmith, receive a deposit receipt, and crack on. The counterfeiting of deposit receipts from these warehouses, not surprisingly, were circulated and modeled currency for the street.

In this way, fractional reserve banking was introduced to England.       

Things worsen as the needs for small business denominations of Royal Copper coins were not being produced, as the Royal Mint saw [copper as unworthy to bear the visage of a king](http://store.mises.org/Good-Money-P519.aspx){:target="_blank"}. This led to the advent of [Tradesman's Tokens](http://www.thecoppercorner.com/history/18thC_hist.html){:target="_blank"}, also known as a "Commercial Tokens," "Specious Tokens," "Private Tokens," "Political Tokens," "Social issues," and "Building Medalets."

While not officially acknowledged by the Royal Mint (they were swiftly outlawed some decades later), they were integral to the success of Industrial Revolutionary England.

Workers could be paid for services rendered. Coins were fungible between butcher and baker, as their shops were owned and operated by earnest and production-ready shopkeepers. There was no central bank of England until [1694](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England){:target="_blank"} and even then these tokens were the standard of the bourgeois class for several decades hence.

Ethereum, Tezos, and other thin-fat protocol projects that enable novel smart contract logic or innovative governance models for blockchains are, in the end, good for Bitcoin investors.

Bitcoin is [sound money](https://mises.org/library/principle-sound-money){:target="_blank"} as gold before it is [hard money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_money_(policy)){:target="_blank"}.

That is to say, bitcoin is a digital commodity money enabling the creation of digital [representative money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money){:target="_blank"}. This is not unlike the physical commodity money gold enabling the creation of country economies with [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money){:target="_blank"}.  

To create your money or money project on the internet, it is best you use bitcoins as both your fundraising mechanism and your store-of-value, in the event your project folds and you are honest enough to renumerate investors. Bitcoin enables free markets by enabling the creation of freely competitive market money.

Applications built atop Ethereum are some other matter, so long as they use the ERC20 or some other Ethereum technical standard.

However, should any of these Ethereum "DAPP" (Decentralized APPlication) projects seek to found their own blockchains, Bitcoin is the internet's secure global standard for crowdsourcing your project. Conservative development by the Bitcoin Core software development team turned out to be the smart technological and investment decision.

The internet officially, according to the market, has its own money and technical standards to fasten and propel any cryptocurrency project that may seek to improve the political or financial system.

However, that is not the role of Bitcoin. [Bitcoin is replacing the Royal Mint](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## The Property Analogy
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 18, 2017

Bitcoin is currently discussed in the context of money because of the unit of account miners engineer during the [mining process](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp){:target="_blank"}. This unit of account is a portable, fungible, divisible, incorruptible, if expensive, digital medium of exchange. It may also be used as storable value. There is a reason for this function. Bitcoin's development methodology and by extension its blockchain [prioritizes security](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation){:target="_blank"}. This means the community culture prioritizes security, demonstrated in Bitcoin's obstinance to be the faster, cheaper blockchain.

The contentious [blocksize debate](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-and-why-does-it-matter/){:target="_blank"} aside, there is a quiet success to this priority. Bitcoin's blockchain managed to create the most valuable digital real estate on the planet. Let us briefly discuss why Bitcoin as a medium of exchange or store of value belies the real value of the right to own property simply by individual choice and monetary decree.

First, to say "I have bitcoins" is something of a misnomer. What you have is access to an address in a database. The database stores data made up of [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit){:target="_blank"} that may be equated and denominated into something resembling money. This is similar to how your local bank denominates the data in your checking account, which are also computer bits in their database. For security reasons, a bank rarely keeps tens of millions of paper dollars at your corner branch for its patrons.

In fact, money today is [nothing more than an entry in a database](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-history-of-the-gold-standard-3306136){:target="_blank"}.

The most valuable money it would stand to reason should be the money whose database is the most secure. How is security measured? In computer systems, usually by their [uptime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime){:target="_blank"}, [latency](https://www.lifewire.com/latency-on-computer-networks-818119){:target="_blank"}, [resiliency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilient_control_systems){:target="_blank"}, and, among other technical things, how willing we are to secure systems versus how willing an attacker is to break them.

The net result of a probabilistically secure system is a system on which we can rely. Now, design the system or computer program with a finite amount of space for storing data. The economic principle says the data in that space should be as valuable as it is scarce, and of increasing interest to interested parties. The data itself may even become increasingly valuable over time assuming the improvement of the system. This is not dissimilar to how we understand ownership of property.

A finite amount of property exists in any given space. Assuming improvement of the surrounding environment, the property within the space may enjoy an increase in value simply because of its location. If said property itself were useful to an interested party, the property may enjoy manifold returns in value for its location to an improving environment and for its usefulness. Imagine owning a small piece of property on Park Avenue in Manhattan circa 1870.

The railroad tracks on Fourth Avenue were first being covered over by pavement to make way for pedestrians and brownstones. Now imagine living long enough to see The Waldorf Astoria, UBS, The Harold Pratt House, and 432 Penthouse go up. Your small property would be worth a large fortune. The surrounding environment of New York City saw unparalleled investment in business infrastructure over the next 147 years.

Finally, the utility of what you built in those days would likely be outmoded, today. But you would have refreshing optionality to sell or even rent your property. Bitcoin's database benefits from being a technology, meaning it is prime location to an improving surrounding environment, in this case the technology industry. What gets built on this property over the next 147 years will be at the discretion of the residents, namely the possessors of the addresses.

## Trust-Minimization
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 16, 2017


Bitcoin is a system first, not a cryptocurrency. The currency is a part of the system, not the system itself. The most important aspect of any currency is the system on which it relies. We have come to trust government-issued currency, for example, because it is familiar but also because we implicitly believe in the accountability of our political process to honor the currency we earn to tender our debts.

If faith in our political system deteriorates, so eventually will the value of its currency. Faith in Bitcoin's system is faith in similar ideas of familiarity and accountability that govern our reliance on political systems. The community however does not rely on or trust any one person or policy. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a system of [mathematical primitives](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1){:target="_blank"} and [peer network consensus](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#term-consensus-rules){:target="_blank"} for both issuance of the currency and for monetary policy.

This allows the system to be exceptionally uncorrelated to the policies and even the volatility of other monetary systems. Resultantly, Bitcoin achieves a third phenomenon unheard of in the history of finance: decentralization by way of [trust-minimization](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html){:target="_blank"}.


Trust-minimization pays homage to rules-based systems and not systems based on rulers. There are different ways to arrive at a rules-based system but proof of conclusion, or a rule executed, is fundamental. In Bitcoin, the [computationally-expensive process](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/555.pdf){:target="_blank"} to "proof of conclusion" is the first principle. A cryptocurrency that prioritizes anything but security will fail at securing what it is prioritizing. The security-for-performance tradeoff is an oldie but goodie in software development. Tech companies in particular are fashionably known for addressing scalability and security issues post-production, prioritizing growth and working out kinks along the way.

Unfortunately, this is bad for protocols.

A holder's faith in Bitcoin is not simplistic faith in the price increasing based on the frenetic adoption of new buyers who see the price increasing. Faith in Bitcoin is faith in the primarily rules-based system's ability to achieve consensus without any [trusted third-party](http://fortune.com/2017/08/31/wells-fargo-fake-accounts-scandal-2017-tim-sloan/){:target="_blank"}. This obliterates the potential for corruption, theft, and seizure of assets from the system, as there is no powerful person to buy off or single server to confiscate. When we hear in polite society "trust the system!" we should hear "trust them, they can enforce this or that outcome," with the unspoken disclaimer 'especially if it benefits the system.' Trust-minimized systems do not assume people are corrupt, simply that they can be, and design technical solutions that make corruption improbable.

## The Engineering Principle
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 12, 2017


Technical work is a thankless job. In the film and television industries, for example, the crew vastly outnumbers the people we see on screen. Yet few members of the audience attend a film to appreciate the precision of makeup applied to an actor or the impeccable lighting of a scene. A discriminating fewer more attend to watch the director think or listen to the writer make rhyme and reason. The vast majority have come to be entertained.

Consequently, the final product is a luxurious abstraction. Impurities are removed. Much of what was shot is left, as is said, "on the cutting room floor." The gorgeous often hyper-productized result is a transmogrified grotesque. Technical people know products only look as good as they work. This is the job of the critic: to parse and judge what the audience cannot to arrive at a standard for making what the audience wants. This is completely different in Bitcoin, where the pubic isn't hidden from the process but rather encouraged to participate in the production.

Bitcoin is open source software with a [well-documented process](https://bitcoincore.org){:target="_blank"} of how it arrives at its standards. Bitcoin is not a company. Bitcoin is not a product. There is no marketing department or holiday sales. There is no charismatic authority or even a real consumer interface.

Can it ever arrive at something for the general public who chooses not to participate? [Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhpg_8D2FPI){:target="_blank"}. [Indeed](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/){:target="_blank"}.

For now, Bitcoin does generate free Bitcoin addresses, on or offline, for every man, woman and child, on planet earth. Software wallets that generate [mnemonic phrases](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase){:target="_blank"} with addresses allow users to backup and restore wallets from any device without knowing the exact number and letter sequence of their private keys. These recovery seeds further allow untrusted third-party systems to generate addresses without the ability to spend any bitcoins associated with these addresses.

This functionality is freely available to every man, woman and child, on planet earth.

Bitcoin does use checksums to prevent typographical errors that may occur if your mother accidentally tries to send bitcoins to an address that does not exist. Bitcoin does have smart contracts known as [P2SH (Pay to script hash)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash){:target="_blank"}, which allows a user to send Bitcoin transactions to a script without knowing the condition(s) the recipient has set up to redeem the coins in the script. The recipient must provide a script matching the script that was sent and data which makes the script evaluate to true.

A married or committed couple may have a type of secure joint-account, what is called a [multi-signature](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature){:target="_blank"} ("multisig") Bitcoin address, where the conditions might be such that one cannot spend bitcoins from the address without the permission of them both.

This functionality is freely available to every man, woman and child, on planet earth. The technical talent of the Bitcoin community is no trivial thing. Some of the world's most talented cryptographers, scientists, engineers, many of whom have created the [systems](https://blockstream.com/team/christopher-allen/){:target="_blank"} and [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Russell){:target="_blank"} your company likely uses today, are contributors to Bitcoin.

They are also volunteers, ensuring the price of Bitcoin is the least interesting thing about it while also being the second most undervalued.

## The Mania of Poverty
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 8, 2017


The blood euphoria of making money speculating on the value of a currency is usually the domain of day traders. Most people are simply unacquainted with having money with which to speculate. People work for money, spend the money they made working, and do it all over again the next day. It has become a miserable and fascinating turn of events. The financial system has gambled with the people's pensions, investments, all with the expectation that the government will pay for their losses. The lack of scarcity in money has made money worthless no matter how much it costs. A putrid old system of pseudo-druids and lenders, the financial institution is clumsily surprised by the working public's interest in a financial asset they own and control.

While retail investors panic buying on exchanges continues to worry institutional investors, CNBC, and a [prize-winning economist](http://fortune.com/2017/11/30/economist-joseph-stiglitz-bitcoin-should-be-outlawed/){:target="_blank"} or [two](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/16/nobel-winning-economist-shiller-calls-bitcoin-a-fad.html){:target="_blank"}, new investors who work day jobs as single parents expecting [maybe 5%](http://www.interest.com/401k/news/kind-return-expect-401k-plans/){:target="_blank"} returns on their 401K are learning the real value of money.

Bitcoin teaches you the value of money, not the utility. Sure, sending money from one person to another using Bitcoin's immutable accountability ledger ([proof-of-work chain](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/11/){:target="_blank"}, or "blockchain") works as promised. It's worked everyday, 24 hours a day, [without fail](http://bitcoinuptime.com){:target="_blank"}, for almost 9 years. But one of its more attractive qualities is its open utility. To buy and hold Bitcoin, you simply need a willingness to learn and the cost of merely a fraction of a Bitcoin, as little as $5.00. To become an [accredited](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp){:target="_blank"} investor, you need a million dollar net worth, or an annual income of $200,000 - $300,000 for at least two years, even if you're technically unqualified.

There are other extraneous qualifications the SEC may invoke to consider you sophisticated enough to know if cartoon dog ears on your social media profile picture is a valuable feature to teenagers. Sophistication is debatable. Crytpocurrencies, generally, regardless of the technology (or lack thereof) underpinning them, are a new asset class for the unsophisticated. Yes, the potential here is an honest market where the value of money is not how often you spend it but how difficult it is for you to part with it. However, it is also about giving regular people the glowing opportunity to learn how to become financially independent, by freely purchasing an asset on an open market without the intrusion of a lender.

## On Intrinsic Value
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 7, 2017

This is a great introduction on Bitcoin as [sound money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukjDCeuNK3Y){:target="_blank"}.

One of the economic definitions we use in Bitcoin regarding sound money is [Bitcoin's deflationary monetary policy](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/5/#selection-51.0-65.17){:target="_blank"}.

This was a [design constraint](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html){:target="_blank"} of creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

Essentially, Bitcoin has a fixed supply limit of coins to be mined and new coins may only be created honestly through the mining process, on an algorithmic schedule. The value of each coin increases over time, as well, [as this limit is met](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/block-reward-halving-a-guide-1354053560/){:target="_blank"}.

Consequently, there will be some speculative mania as more people seek to acquire new coins faster than the system can supply them. As with any asset, a part of the value of each coin is based on demand.

## The Final Problem
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 4, 2017


To be fair, I have not read Instagram's fine print. Like you, I am near certain that it says, in so many words, that if I try and take them to court for illegal use of a photo to which I claim ownership I have no right. By using Instagram, I implicitly (and explicitly through their Terms of Service) have said, in so many words, that my images are not my own. I am fine with this because I presumably find more value in sharing the photo than owning it.

This is the consumer internet. Digital objects I create on private platforms are not my own. This is a fair exchange if less than ideal. There is no one forcing me to use these services. I am free to post updates to my life and connect with far-away strangers, friends and family, in exchange for my documents, videos and family photos existing effectively as private property on these platforms.

The problem is someone can copy my Instagram photos, pass them off as their own, and sell them for a profit, even while Instagram "owns them." They can do further damage if they bypass the security that is supposed to only show my account to people I approve and expose my photos to people of whom I do not approve, such as a crazy ex-lover or political oppressor.

There is no uniqueness of digital objects let alone accountability of possession in software. Even trusted third-parties [cannot always be trusted](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do){:target="_blank"}. How can anyone earn a living being creative let alone manage a large enterprise business on the internet with no security or uniqueness? A photo or any unique digital object is worthless if someone else can present and say they possess the original copy.

This is the Final Problem.

The solution is rather obvious today: decentralize trust and organization, and incentivize a network of accountability based on game theory, math and [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography){:target="_blank"}. Obviously. Bitcoin solves this Problem. Bitcoin is a distributed computer network that simply verifies the state of an intrinsic ledger of accountability without a trusted third-party. This ledger is a collection of events that have occurred, namely financial transactions between two or more individuals or machines.

This computer network is decentralized. These computers are voluntary individuals (or pools of individuals in the case of mining) running the Bitcoin software. [Miners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp){:target="_blank"} run the software for profit and do so independent of the personal or monetary needs of the ecosystem. [Nodes](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node){:target="_blank"} run the software to enforce the consensus rules of the computer network and to authenticate their own transaction data without a trusted third-party, such as a miner or cryptocurrency exchange.

So what problem did Bitcoin specifically solve? The answer is the value of software irreplicability. We discussed that if I send you a document, a YouTube video or a cat photo, that it is merely a copy of the original. While the original copy exists in my possession, there is nothing stopping me from sending a copy to someone else. There is also nothing stopping you from sending a copy to someone else and passing it off as the original. Sufficient technical skills would even allow you to modify the timestamp of the document, video or photo, and any other data associated with it.

This makes the digital object in question ephemeral, which is in part why we prioritize the authorship of objects on the internet, not the value of them. What makes some _thing_ valuable on the internet is the same as what makes something valuable in real life: [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity){:target="_blank"}.

The Bitcoin network has a hard cap of 21 million coins to be mined every 10 minutes. These scarce digital objects cannot be replicated. The mining process is the only way new bitcoins are created. There is no other way to create new coins. You can earn them, buy them, be gifted them, or even steal them from unsuspecting persons or machines, but they can only be created honestly.

The computer network achieves consensus by rejecting any person or machine that would attempt to increase or decrease the 21 million cap, or any person or machine attempting to create new coins without submitting the [agreed upon information](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference){:target="_blank"} to be included in each new block of transactions.

This is how scarcity and security (and thus value) are achieved on the Bitcoin computer network.

The miners and nodes function as checkpoints of accountability to ensure that the network as a whole enforces the technical and consensus parameters. Traditionally, someone was needed to be in charge of managing who owns each valuable object at any given time (such as a bank). If valuable objects are traded, bought or sold frequently (such as currencies), someone further was needed to manage how another person acquires them, when another person has them, etc.

Bitcoin's codebase provides a [built-in incentive](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/){:target="_blank"} for miners to maintain the integrity and sequence of blocks on the computer network. This in part is what prevents replicability. This is also what allows the computer network to be decentralized. The current reward for miners who discover and broadcast new blocks to be added to Bitcoin's intrinsic ledger (blockchain) is 12.5 bitcoins ($145,277.56 USD + fees).

If a miner attempts to add 15 bitcoins or 12.3 bitcoins to their block when they broadcast it, that block will be rejected. The computer network ensures no one can counterfeit blocks or coins, or ownership of coins, at any given time. This is notably achieved without the need for any one person or machine to have control over this process.

This process and computer network together is called [Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## A Big Idea
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 3, 2017

I believe it is technologically feasible to create a passive income architecture with Bitcoin. I imagine this as the market-based solution to a more political Universal Basic Income.

American households could participate in solar-powered mining pools owned by residents and the city. Residents would have mobile wallets like today except with mining data and controls for adjusting everything from energy expenditure to what pools have the best rates. States would compete to see who has the greenest and most profitable pools for bragging rights and tax incentives.

It may also be a non-controversial path to [renewable energy infrastructure investment](https://coincenter.org/entry/how-bitcoin-could-drive-the-clean-energy-revolution){:target="_blank"}.

The foundation is to continue building the family home on the consumer appliance. I believe the 21st century appliance boom should be [energy-efficient, plug-and-play Bitcoin nodes](http://bitseed.org){:target="_blank"}, [elegant mining hardware](https://halongmining.com){:target="_blank"}, and even [small satellites](https://blockstream.com/satellite/){:target="_blank"} for neighborhoods, as modems, routers and electrical grids were in the 20th century.

This would not only prove politically popular with constituents but also with politicians.

Such an architecture would allow for some insight into how consumers are earning bitcoins but not necessarily what they're doing with them. **If you're new to this blog, you should know I do not personally support government surveillance, intervention or unnecessary regulation. I mention the State participating at the local level only as a potential scalable outcome**.

A privacy option to participate in public mining and not share in tax incentives is only a slightly better market solution but could be provided.

Another argument would be on the modernity of government. Young people (people, generally, I would contest) perceive the State as ineffectual, timid and out-of-touch. A focus on the family and their direct prosperity graphically aligns with a politician's public morality.

American households would learn not only the value of creating wealth as a family but what it means to be one with your neighbors. There is a common conversation in America which is indirectly scaling financial literacy. This can be done from any home or apartment, whether single or married, as energy expenditure from the right product would be low and ultimately paid for by energy consumed from the sun, further distilled and offered by the city. You just need the appliances.

Families may mine Bitcoin on autopilot for shares of the [block reward](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/){:target="_blank"} without relying on petroleum as an energy source.

Payment routing as another income stream has even more potential, with [little configuration and no daily effort](https://lightning.engineering){:target="_blank"}. Lightning Network nodes may route payments as banks do today. There was more configuration setting up my mother's [Roku](https://www.roku.com/index) than there is setting up a [Lightning full node and wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhpg_8D2FPI).

As running a full node is incentivized, the cost for running a node is absorbed in the fees earned with any residual income as profit for the server.

Imagine commercials with a young girl on her mother's lap pointing at the screen asking questions about the family's mining and banking operations. Ambitious politicians arguing today for basic income as a safety net could campaign on the rhetoric of building American wealth to end poverty.

This would be intoxicating to constituents but this time within a voter's arm's reach.

Retail banking should migrate to the family household. Much of what is performed by banking institutions with databases and extraneous fee structures may be automated and captured by the family investor.

A decentralized network of computers verifying the transactions for millions of people around the world already exists, successfully, with Bitcoin.

A decentralized financial system, with the option to share data with interested parties, is a confident first step toward something resembling a universal basic income, without further mismanaging privacy or the tax code.

## The Modern Family
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 30, 2017


Steve Jobs had a simple vision: one day every family would own a personal computer. That vision came true. Today, most Western households own at least one desktop or laptop computer. Most also own an array of mobile pocket supercomputers, complete with high resolution graphics, sensing cameras, speech recognition; a virtual assistant; proximity, light and moisture sensors; a three-axis gyroscope, a barometer, and software with the response and reliability of any sophisticated modern machine.

While this does not come close to enumerating the specs of the iPhone, you get the point. We are far more tech savvy than we care to admit. The issue of late is how much our computer devices are savvy of us. I am specifically interested in the value they generate compared to the amount of real dollars we spend on them. The iPhone is an extraordinary device. Nonetheless, only the exceptionally tech savvy may build applications and make decent money with them.

I believe we have adopted a consumerist disposition to a creative medium. I question, why haven't these devices enhanced our ability to work less, buy less, and do more? Why are they not at a minimum generating a basic income for us to pay for their services, let alone our monthly debts and mortgages?

The question is equally sociological as economic. We were champion consumers throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The home appliances market exploded and many working-class families from around the world bought them. Most people prided themselves on how much stuff they owned. The internet's business model was bootstrapped with the same model that bootstrapped the television industry: advertising. Working-class families after a hard day's work discovered new products to purchase while being entertained by television programs. Sadly, the internet has become a shopping and entertainment portal not dissimilar to the legacy television networks.

However, this might be a transient state. I believe we can be weaned off of consumption and suckled on the fruits of our own production. The end result may not only be an increase in wealth but a reduction in the non-creative work necessary to generate it. I am talking about a more modern system capable of storing incorruptible monetary value whose currency is capable of instant machine-to-machine payments. You know where this is going.

Just as nearly every working-class home over the last 20 years has purchased some form of internet-connected computer, I believe every home over the next 20 years should be a participant in a global financial system. In the 20 years since Jobs returned to Apple (1997) with a vision for how to rebuild a company on the brink of bankruptcy, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system emerged to do the same for the working-class family. Modems, routers and smartphones, were the first wave yet required the advertising model to fund its creative outlet: the internet. Miners, routers ([Lightning Network](https://lightning.network){:target="_blank"} nodes on [Bitcoin Fibre](http://bitcoinfibre.org){:target="_blank"}) and Bitcoin wallets may be required to migrate the working-class family from consumers to shareholder.

## Personal Responsibility

As we migrate from consumer to equal partner in our new global financial system, there are some best practices you should be acquainted with going forward. First, never keep your bitcoins or any significant amount of fiat money (dollars, euros, yen, rubles, etc. ) on a cryptocurrency exchange. This is not because exchanges are unethical or incompetent. While this is certainly relevant to some exchanges these aren't the early days of Mt. Gox. Exchanges and what the community expects of them has dramatically improved. It is because exchanges are first and foremost centralized, and therefore easier to attack, litigate, or hold hostage.

Second, because Bitcoin is not about trusted third-parties managing your cryptocurrency. Your interface to Bitcoin so far has likely been through a third-party service, perhaps even one that holds the private keys to your coins. This is highly inadvisable. Letting someone else control your private keys means they say when and how you have access to your bitcoins.

Unfortunately this is common and obscures the reason why Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin's system of exchange (what inventor Satoshi Nakamoto called a "proof-of-work chain," also known as "blockchain,") is designed to be peer-to-peer, meaning between you and another person (or machine). Your interface to Bitcoin would be better understood with someone sending you bitcoins directly to a wallet where you own and control the private keys. I will discuss more of this and other best practices in later posts.

For now, if you do not have an approved Bitcoin wallet (one whose codebase is open source and may be peer reviewed, battle-tested and compared), check out [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet){:target="_blank"} for recommended desktop, hardware and software wallets. I personally prefer Bitcoin Core (desktop), Digital Bitbox for my hardware wallet, and Green Address and BitGo for mobile.

However, you should choose what best serves your needs. Maybe it's Ledger Nano S for your hardware wallet and Mycelium for your software wallet. Regardless, all of these give you ownership of your private keys. Purchasing bitcoins from an exchange like Gemini is fine, though [more private options exist](https://bisq.network){:target="_blank"}. Just make sure the moment you purchase bitcoins from Gemini, or any exchange, you immediately send them to a wallet where you control the private keys.

You are in control.

## On Antifragility

Systems as with people improve when they profit from information. But some information cannot be researched. One of life's annoying little lessons is that durable information may be only be acquired through experience. For a citizenry crudely optimized for efficiency this is not a welcome development. The process is uncivilized, error prone, and reductionist. But this is how we learn to be efficient in the absence of fantasy: experimentation.

Bitcoin is a trust-minimized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that gains from disorder. As a singularity the system is more organism than state machine and evolves somewhat similarly. Information propagates through the network by way of unit tests and attacks, price discovery and speculation, until it is battle-tested with nothing more than pure nature to kill it or make it stronger.
