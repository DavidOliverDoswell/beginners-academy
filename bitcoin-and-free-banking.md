## On Bitcoin and Free Banking

The Bitcoin blockchain is the most advanced, battle-tested database in production. It is the only immutable record of history in the world, a global supercomputer ensuring no participating actor may cheat the system, forge a signature, or steal any units of account.

It is more deeply an information system of [secure property with owner authority](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/){:target="_blank"}, mapping properties (and their transfer, division, and merging) to [public keypairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography){:target="_blank"} and controlling those operations with said keys.

This system is not easily subjected to hard forking its core protocol because of market demand. Bitcoin is not a company, a product, or a service (barring conventional uses of the word "service"). The system is not hierarchical, centralized, or expedient.

Any person or organization may participate in the system and be equal to every other person or organization in the system, were they willing to contribute the same amount of value of said persons or organizations.

There is something, too, uniquely relevant to the timing of the invention.

Bitcoin is a not democracy and is not designed to improve the current political or financial system.

Bitcoin is cryptoanarchy: a political ideology that believes that messages and transactions over insecure public networks, such as the internet, should be protected by strong cryptographic primitives, holding true that individuals are sovereign and should make decisions based on what's best for them and not the group.

It is an honest and practical view of the world. Most humans [practice it everyday](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prisoners-dilemma){:target="_blank"}, if unwittingly.

People would prefer more privacy than less. People would prefer of their own volition to selectively reveal and articulate themselves to the world.

People should, too, then have the respect of being addressed and appropriated based on their requests. These ideas, while free-thinking and info-modern, maximize trust in the individual and minimize the necessity to trust in others.

It is counterintuitive but this is what strengthens a system and the relationships between individuals within a system over time.

Strong people enforce strong realities and have the capacity to maintain strong relationships. The transition from dependence on trusted-third parties to decentralized crypto-systems maintained by strong participating actors is a work in progress.

Systems are, after all, easier to design than psychologies. However, better systems are required.

Education, mentorship, and good design (better defaults in software and hardware development) are antecedents to this physical pro-form. Bitcoin is the foundational reality of this new digital epoch. Here's why:

January 2017 saw the beginning of the end of public banking. The [ICO ("initial coin offering")](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/ico-explained){:target="_blank"} boom year saw public blockchain experiments [financing their crowdsourced crypto projects with bitcoins](https://www.tezos.com/help){:target="_blank"}.

[Ethereum itself was an ICO](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/){:target="_blank"} and raised capital using bitcoins, maybe the most successful ICO project to date. Ethereum is now the leading platform for building cryptocurrency applications. Contrary to many of my contemporaries, I think this is good for Bitcoin.

Private and free banking is how markets are supposed to work. The market should decide what money is at any time during a private transaction. If I prefer your shirt, for example, to your government-issued money, your cryptocurrency token, or your shiny gold ETF certificate, that should suffice.

Public and private blockchain experiments, however ambitious, criminal, or sophomoric, are positive examples of free banking. Historical precedents for similar realities have been documented, namely during the Industrial Revolution in Britain.

In the mid 1640s, Charles I of England, who believed in the "divine right of kings," [confiscated 130,000 pounds of silver bullion from the Royal Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England){:target="_blank"}, calling it "a loan" at 8%.

Although returned, goldsmiths were spooked and began withdrawing their gold from the Royal Mint out of fear of future confiscation. Goldsmiths immediately began storing gold in their personal coffers inside private warehouses in London.

Holders of gold, too, were satisfied and could easily deposit their gold with a goldsmith, receive a deposit receipt, and crack on. The counterfeiting of deposit receipts from these warehouses, not surprisingly, were circulated and modeled currency for the street.

In this way, fractional reserve banking was introduced to England.       

Things worsen as the needs for small business denominations of Royal Copper coins were not being produced, as the Royal Mint saw [copper as unworthy to bear the visage of a king](http://store.mises.org/Good-Money-P519.aspx){:target="_blank"}. This led to the advent of [Tradesman's Tokens](http://www.thecoppercorner.com/history/18thC_hist.html){:target="_blank"}, also known as a "Commercial Tokens," "Specious Tokens," "Private Tokens," "Political Tokens," "Social issues," and "Building Medalets."

While not officially acknowledged by the Royal Mint (they were swiftly outlawed some decades later), they were integral to the success of Industrial Revolutionary England.

Workers could be paid for services rendered. Coins were fungible between butcher and baker, as their shops were owned and operated by earnest and production-ready shopkeepers. There was no central bank of England until [1694](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England){:target="_blank"} and even then these tokens were the standard of the bourgeois class for several decades hence.

Ethereum, Tezos, and other thin-fat protocol projects that enable novel smart contract logic or innovative governance models for blockchains are, in the end, good for Bitcoin investors.

Bitcoin is [sound money](https://mises.org/library/principle-sound-money){:target="_blank"} as gold before it is [hard money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_money_(policy)){:target="_blank"}.

That is to say, bitcoin is a digital commodity money enabling the creation of digital [representative money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money){:target="_blank"}. This is not unlike the physical commodity money gold enabling the creation of country economies with [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money){:target="_blank"}.  

To create your money or money project on the internet, it is best you use bitcoins as both your fundraising mechanism and your store-of-value, in the event your project folds and you are honest enough to renumerate investors. Bitcoin enables free markets by enabling the creation of freely competitive market money.

Applications built atop Ethereum are some other matter, so long as they use the ERC20 or some other Ethereum technical standard.

However, should any of these Ethereum "DAPP" (Decentralized APPlication) projects seek to found their own blockchains, Bitcoin is the internet's secure global standard for crowdsourcing your project. Conservative development by the Bitcoin Core software development team turned out to be the smart technological and investment decision.

The internet unofficially has its own money and technical standards to fasten and propel any cryptocurrency project that may seek to improve the political or financial system.

This is not the role of Bitcoin. [Bitcoin is replacing the Royal Mint](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/){:target="_blank"}.
