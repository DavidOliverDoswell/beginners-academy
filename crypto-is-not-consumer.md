## Crypto is Not Consumer ( A Thread )

1. Crypto is Not Consumer.
2. What is called “crypto,” today, is the startup version of society as a gaming console.
3. Every startup becomes an application with a coin to play a particular game.
4. However, crypto more fundamentally permits the proprietary control of identity and property using a set of easily and freely generated key pairs.
5. Crypto is not about startups. Crypto is about privacy.
6. Applied to currency, crypto is concerned with the designation of any geographical boundary on planet earth as a marketplace, requiring nothing more than a general-purpose language for negotiation.
7. The language here is money (specifically, a string of alphanumeric characters representing any value by two or more counterparties).
8. In popular culture, “crypto” is about making startups and investors rich, in exchange for making the world a better place through products and services for consumers.
9. In subversive culture, “crypto” is about making individuals sovereign, competent, cunning, and thus potentially rich.
10. Pop crypto would prioritize public infrastructure, community, and developer compensation.
11. Stability is everything, as “markets hate uncertainty.”
12. Sub crypto would prioritize private infrastructure, liberty, and developer tools.
13. Stability is mythic, as markets are phenomenal.
14. Projects designed with crypto but are amenable to ancillary standards that compromise crypto are not crypto projects. They are startups (fine); or idea-porn (dreck).
15. I am hesitant to designate any startup as a crypto project unless it is decentralized, in which case it has not filed any articles of incorporation or taken any outside capital.
16. Another nit: if the maintainer of a codebase is anything more than an administrator of consensus, the project is not decentralized.
17. Satoshi was never a “leader.” That is our familiar, hierarchical, consumerist view of being a part of something. Gavin was not a leader, either (jokingly referring to himself as a benevolent one).
18. Satoshi was a creator. Gavin was a repo maintainer. That is the language of open source software development.
19. Perhaps a consensus for open vs. closed would better serve modern blockchain development, regardless of the technology employed, as “crypto” today is marketing copy.
20. “Crypto” should be seen as suspect so long as any internal or external authority can roll back the chain, mitigate txs, or influence a trade, without the rough consensus of participating players.
