## Thoughts on Mania and Poverty

The blood euphoria of making money speculating on the value of a currency is usually the domain of day traders. Most people are simply unacquainted with having money with which to speculate. People work for money, spend the money they made working, and do it all over again the next day. It has become a miserable and fascinating turn of events. The financial system has gambled with the people's pensions, investments, all with the expectation that the government will pay for their losses. The lack of scarcity in money has made money worthless no matter how much it costs. A putrid old system of pseudo-druids and lenders, the financial institution is clumsily surprised by the working public's interest in a financial asset they own and control.

While retail investors panic buying on exchanges continues to worry institutional investors, CNBC, and a [prize-winning economist](http://fortune.com/2017/11/30/economist-joseph-stiglitz-bitcoin-should-be-outlawed/){:target="_blank"} or [two](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/16/nobel-winning-economist-shiller-calls-bitcoin-a-fad.html){:target="_blank"}, new investors who work day jobs as single parents expecting [maybe 5%](http://www.interest.com/401k/news/kind-return-expect-401k-plans/){:target="_blank"} returns on their 401K are learning the real value of money.

Bitcoin teaches you the value of money, not the utility. Sure, sending money from one person to another using Bitcoin's immutable accountability ledger ([proof-of-work chain](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/11/){:target="_blank"}, or "blockchain") works as promised. It's worked everyday, 24 hours a day, [without fail](http://bitcoinuptime.com){:target="_blank"}, for almost 9 years. But one of its more attractive qualities is its future utility. Bitcoin is an investment property, not a speculative instrument. Good investments mature over time and leverage the holder that wealth may be accumulated. Bitcoin's notable value is not the fiat market dollar amount associated with it but the technology allowing its transfer and control to be uniquely subjected to the holder.

To buy and hold Bitcoin, you simply need a willingness to learn and the cost of merely a fraction of a Bitcoin, as little as $5.00. Conversely, to become an [accredited](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp){:target="_blank"} investor, you need a million dollar net worth, or an annual income of $200,000 - $300,000 for at least two years, even if you're technically unqualified.

There are other extraneous qualifications the SEC may invoke to consider you sophisticated enough to know if cartoon dog ears on your social media profile picture is a valuable feature to teenagers. Sophistication is debatable. Crytpocurrencies, generally, regardless of the technology (or lack thereof) underpinning them, are a new asset class for the unsophisticated. Yes, the potential here is an honest market where the value of money is not how often you spend it but how difficult it is for you to part with it. However, it is also about giving regular people the glowing opportunity to learn how to become financially independent, by freely purchasing an asset on an open market without the intrusion of a lender.
