## A Big Idea
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 3, 2017

I believe it is technologically feasible to create a passive income architecture with Bitcoin. I imagine this as the market-based solution to a more political Universal Basic Income.

American households could participate in solar-powered mining pools owned by residents and the city. Residents would have mobile wallets like today except with mining data and controls for adjusting everything from energy expenditure to what pools have the best rates. States would compete to see who has the greenest and most profitable pools for bragging rights and tax incentives.

It may also be a non-controversial path to [renewable energy infrastructure investment](https://coincenter.org/entry/how-bitcoin-could-drive-the-clean-energy-revolution){:target="_blank"}.

The foundation is to continue building the family home on the consumer appliance. I believe the 21st century appliance boom should be [energy-efficient, plug-and-play Bitcoin nodes](http://bitseed.org){:target="_blank"}, [elegant mining hardware](https://halongmining.com){:target="_blank"}, and even [small satellites](https://blockstream.com/satellite/){:target="_blank"} for neighborhoods, as modems, routers and electrical grids were in the 20th century.

This would not only prove politically popular with constituents but also with politicians.

Such an architecture would allow for some insight into how consumers are earning bitcoins but not necessarily what they're doing with them. **If you're new to this blog, you should know I do not personally support government surveillance, intervention or unnecessary regulation. I mention the State participating at the local level only as a potential scalable outcome**.

A privacy option to participate in public mining and not share in tax incentives is only a slightly better market solution but could be provided.

Another argument would be on the modernity of government. Young people (people, generally, I would contest) perceive the State as ineffectual, timid and out-of-touch. A focus on the family and their direct prosperity graphically aligns with a politician's public morality.

American households would learn not only the value of creating wealth as a family but what it means to be one with your neighbors. There is a common conversation in America which is indirectly scaling financial literacy. This can be done from any home or apartment, whether single or married, as energy expenditure from the right product would be low and ultimately paid for by energy consumed from the sun, further distilled and offered by the city. You just need the appliances.

Families may mine Bitcoin on autopilot for shares of the [block reward](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/){:target="_blank"} without relying on petroleum as an energy source.

Payment routing as another income stream has even more potential, with [little configuration and no daily effort](https://lightning.engineering){:target="_blank"}. Lightning Network nodes may route payments as banks do today. There was more configuration setting up my mother's [Roku](https://www.roku.com/index) than there is setting up a [Lightning full node and wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhpg_8D2FPI).

As running a full node is incentivized, the cost for running a node is absorbed in the fees earned with any residual income as profit for the server.

Imagine commercials with a young girl on her mother's lap pointing at the screen asking questions about the family's mining and banking operations. Ambitious politicians arguing today for basic income as a safety net could campaign on the rhetoric of building American wealth to end poverty.

This would be intoxicating to constituents but this time within a voter's arm's reach.

Retail banking should migrate to the family household. Much of what is performed by banking institutions with databases and extraneous fee structures may be automated and captured by the family investor.

A decentralized network of computers verifying the transactions for millions of people around the world already exists, successfully, with Bitcoin.

A decentralized financial system, with the option to share data with interested parties, is a confident first step toward something resembling a universal basic income, without further mismanaging privacy or the tax code.

## The Modern Family
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 30, 2017


Steve Jobs had a simple vision: one day every family would own a personal computer. That vision came true. Today, most Western households own at least one desktop or laptop computer. Most also own an array of mobile pocket supercomputers, complete with high resolution graphics, sensing cameras, speech recognition; a virtual assistant; proximity, light and moisture sensors; a three-axis gyroscope, a barometer, and software with the response and reliability of any sophisticated modern machine.

While this does not come close to enumerating the specs of the iPhone, you get the point. We are far more tech savvy than we care to admit. The issue of late is how much our computer devices are savvy of us. I am specifically interested in the value they generate compared to the amount of real dollars we spend on them. The iPhone is an extraordinary device. Nonetheless, only the exceptionally tech savvy may build applications and make decent money with them.

I believe we have adopted a consumerist disposition to a creative medium. I question, why haven't these devices enhanced our ability to work less, buy less, and do more? Why are they not at a minimum generating a basic income for us to pay for their services, let alone our monthly debts and mortgages?

The question is equally sociological as economic. We were champion consumers throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The home appliances market exploded and many working-class families from around the world bought them. Most people prided themselves on how much stuff they owned. The internet's business model was bootstrapped with the same model that bootstrapped the television industry: advertising. Working-class families after a hard day's work discovered new products to purchase while being entertained by television programs. Sadly, the internet has become a shopping and entertainment portal not dissimilar to the legacy television networks.

However, this might be a transient state. I believe we can be weaned off of consumption and suckled on the fruits of our own production. The end result may not only be an increase in wealth but a reduction in the non-creative work necessary to generate it. I am talking about a more modern system capable of storing incorruptible monetary value whose currency is capable of instant machine-to-machine payments. You know where this is going.

Just as nearly every working-class home over the last 20 years has purchased some form of internet-connected computer, I believe every home over the next 20 years should be a participant in a global financial system. In the 20 years since Jobs returned to Apple (1997) with a vision for how to rebuild a company on the brink of bankruptcy, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system emerged to do the same for the working-class family. Modems, routers and smartphones, were the first wave yet required the advertising model to fund its creative outlet: the internet. Miners, routers ([Lightning Network](https://lightning.network){:target="_blank"} nodes on [Bitcoin Fibre](http://bitcoinfibre.org){:target="_blank"}) and Bitcoin wallets may be required to migrate the working-class family from consumers to shareholder.

## Personal Responsibility
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 29, 2017


As we migrate from consumer to equal partner in our new global financial system, there are some best practices you should be acquainted with going forward. First, never keep your bitcoins or any significant amount of fiat money (dollars, euros, yen, rubles, etc. ) on a cryptocurrency exchange. This is not because exchanges are unethical or incompetent. While this is certainly relevant to some exchanges these aren't the early days of Mt. Gox. Exchanges and what the community expects of them has dramatically improved. It is because exchanges are first and foremost centralized, and therefore easier to attack, litigate, or hold hostage.

Second, because Bitcoin is not about trusted third-parties managing your cryptocurrency. Your interface to Bitcoin so far has likely been through a third-party service, perhaps even one that holds the private keys to your coins. This is highly inadvisable. Letting someone else control your private keys means they say when and how you have access to your bitcoins.

Unfortunately this is common and obscures the reason why Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin's system of exchange (what inventor Satoshi Nakamoto called a "proof-of-work chain," also known as "blockchain,") is designed to be peer-to-peer, meaning between you and another person (or machine). Your interface to Bitcoin would be better understood with someone sending you bitcoins directly to a wallet where you own and control the private keys. I will discuss more of this and other best practices in later posts.

For now, if you do not have an approved Bitcoin wallet (one whose codebase is open source and may be peer reviewed, battle-tested and compared), check out [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet){:target="_blank"} for recommended desktop, hardware and software wallets. I personally prefer Bitcoin Core (desktop), Digital Bitbox for my hardware wallet, and Green Address and BitGo for mobile.

However, you should choose what best serves your needs. Maybe it's Ledger Nano S for your hardware wallet and Mycelium for your software wallet. Regardless, all of these give you ownership of your private keys. Purchasing bitcoins from an exchange like Gemini is fine, though [more private options exist](https://bisq.network){:target="_blank"}. Just make sure the moment you purchase bitcoins from Gemini, or any exchange, you immediately send them to a wallet where you control the private keys.

You are in control.

## On Antifragility
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 29, 2017


Systems as with people improve when they profit from information. But some information cannot be researched. One of life's annoying little lessons is that durable information may be only be acquired through experience. For a citizenry crudely optimized for efficiency this is not a welcome development. The process is uncivilized, error prone, and reductionist. But this is how we learn to be efficient in the absence of fantasy: experimentation.

Bitcoin is a trust-minimized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that gains from disorder. As a singularity the system is more organism than state machine and evolves somewhat similarly. Information propagates through the network by way of unit tests and attacks, price discovery and speculation, until it is battle-tested with nothing more than pure nature to kill it or make it stronger.
