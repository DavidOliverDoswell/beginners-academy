## The Final Problem
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 4, 2017


To be fair, I have not read Instagram's fine print. Like you, I am near certain that it says, in so many words, that if I try and take them to court for illegal use of a photo to which I claim ownership I have no right. By using Instagram, I implicitly (and explicitly through their Terms of Service) have said, in so many words, that my images are not my own. I am fine with this because I presumably find more value in sharing the photo than owning it.

This is the consumer internet. Digital objects I create on private platforms are not my own. This is a fair exchange if less than ideal. There is no one forcing me to use these services. I am free to post updates to my life and connect with far-away strangers, friends and family, in exchange for my documents, videos and family photos existing effectively as private property on these platforms.

The problem is someone can copy my Instagram photos, pass them off as their own, and sell them for a profit, even while Instagram "owns them." They can do further damage if they bypass the security that is supposed to only show my account to people I approve and expose my photos to people of whom I do not approve, such as a crazy ex-lover or political oppressor.

There is no uniqueness of digital objects let alone accountability of possession in software. Even trusted third-parties [cannot always be trusted](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do){:target="_blank"}. How can anyone earn a living being creative let alone manage a large enterprise business on the internet with no security or uniqueness? A photo or any unique digital object is worthless if someone else can present and say they possess the original copy.

This is the Final Problem.

The solution is rather obvious today: decentralize trust and organization, and incentivize a network of accountability based on game theory, math and [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography){:target="_blank"}. Obviously. Bitcoin solves this Problem. Bitcoin is a distributed computer network that simply verifies the state of an intrinsic ledger of accountability without a trusted third-party. This ledger is a collection of events that have occurred, namely financial transactions between two or more individuals or machines.

This computer network is decentralized. These computers are voluntary individuals (or pools of individuals in the case of mining) running the Bitcoin software. [Miners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp){:target="_blank"} run the software for profit and do so independent of the personal or monetary needs of the ecosystem. [Nodes](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node){:target="_blank"} run the software to enforce the consensus rules of the computer network and to authenticate their own transaction data without a trusted third-party, such as a miner or cryptocurrency exchange.

So what problem did Bitcoin specifically solve? The answer is the value of software irreplicability. We discussed that if I send you a document, a YouTube video or a cat photo, that it is merely a copy of the original. While the original copy exists in my possession, there is nothing stopping me from sending a copy to someone else. There is also nothing stopping you from sending a copy to someone else and passing it off as the original. Sufficient technical skills would even allow you to modify the timestamp of the document, video or photo, and any other data associated with it.

This makes the digital object in question ephemeral, which is in part why we prioritize the authorship of objects on the internet, not the value of them. What makes some _thing_ valuable on the internet is the same as what makes something valuable in real life: [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity){:target="_blank"}.

The Bitcoin network has a hard cap of 21 million coins to be mined every 10 minutes. These scarce digital objects cannot be replicated. The mining process is the only way new bitcoins are created. There is no other way to create new coins. You can earn them, buy them, be gifted them, or even steal them from unsuspecting persons or machines, but they can only be created honestly.

The computer network achieves consensus by rejecting any person or machine that would attempt to increase or decrease the 21 million cap, or any person or machine attempting to create new coins without submitting the [agreed upon information](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference){:target="_blank"} to be included in each new block of transactions.

This is how scarcity and security (and thus value) are achieved on the Bitcoin computer network.

The miners and nodes function as checkpoints of accountability to ensure that the network as a whole enforces the technical and consensus parameters. Traditionally, someone was needed to be in charge of managing who owns each valuable object at any given time (such as a bank). If valuable objects are traded, bought or sold frequently (such as currencies), someone further was needed to manage how another person acquires them, when another person has them, etc.

Bitcoin's codebase provides a [built-in incentive](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/){:target="_blank"} for miners to maintain the integrity and sequence of blocks on the computer network. This in part is what prevents replicability. This is also what allows the computer network to be decentralized. The current reward for miners who discover and broadcast new blocks to be added to Bitcoin's intrinsic ledger (blockchain) is 12.5 bitcoins ($145,277.56 USD + fees).

If a miner attempts to add 15 bitcoins or 12.3 bitcoins to their block when they broadcast it, that block will be rejected. The computer network ensures no one can counterfeit blocks or coins, or ownership of coins, at any given time. This is notably achieved without the need for any one person or machine to have control over this process.

This process and computer network together is called [Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## A Big Idea
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### December 3, 2017

I believe it is technologically feasible to create a passive income architecture with Bitcoin. I imagine this as the market-based solution to a more political Universal Basic Income.

American households could participate in solar-powered mining pools owned by residents and the city. Residents would have mobile wallets like today except with mining data and controls for adjusting everything from energy expenditure to what pools have the best rates. States would compete to see who has the greenest and most profitable pools for bragging rights and tax incentives.

It may also be a non-controversial path to [renewable energy infrastructure investment](https://coincenter.org/entry/how-bitcoin-could-drive-the-clean-energy-revolution){:target="_blank"}.

The foundation is to continue building the family home on the consumer appliance. I believe the 21st century appliance boom should be [energy-efficient, plug-and-play Bitcoin nodes](http://bitseed.org){:target="_blank"}, [elegant mining hardware](https://halongmining.com){:target="_blank"}, and even [small satellites](https://blockstream.com/satellite/){:target="_blank"} for neighborhoods, as modems, routers and electrical grids were in the 20th century.

This would not only prove politically popular with constituents but also with politicians.

Such an architecture would allow for some insight into how consumers are earning bitcoins but not necessarily what they're doing with them. **If you're new to this blog, you should know I do not personally support government surveillance, intervention or unnecessary regulation. I mention the State participating at the local level only as a potential scalable outcome**.

A privacy option to participate in public mining and not share in tax incentives is only a slightly better market solution but could be provided.

Another argument would be on the modernity of government. Young people (people, generally, I would contest) perceive the State as ineffectual, timid and out-of-touch. A focus on the family and their direct prosperity graphically aligns with a politician's public morality.

American households would learn not only the value of creating wealth as a family but what it means to be one with your neighbors. There is a common conversation in America which is indirectly scaling financial literacy. This can be done from any home or apartment, whether single or married, as energy expenditure from the right product would be low and ultimately paid for by energy consumed from the sun, further distilled and offered by the city. You just need the appliances.

Families may mine Bitcoin on autopilot for shares of the [block reward](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/){:target="_blank"} without relying on petroleum as an energy source.

Payment routing as another income stream has even more potential, with [little configuration and no daily effort](https://lightning.engineering){:target="_blank"}. Lightning Network nodes may route payments as banks do today. There was more configuration setting up my mother's [Roku](https://www.roku.com/index) than there is setting up a [Lightning full node and wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhpg_8D2FPI).

As running a full node is incentivized, the cost for running a node is absorbed in the fees earned with any residual income as profit for the server.

Imagine commercials with a young girl on her mother's lap pointing at the screen asking questions about the family's mining and banking operations. Ambitious politicians arguing today for basic income as a safety net could campaign on the rhetoric of building American wealth to end poverty.

This would be intoxicating to constituents but this time within a voter's arm's reach.

Retail banking should migrate to the family household. Much of what is performed by banking institutions with databases and extraneous fee structures may be automated and captured by the family investor.

A decentralized network of computers verifying the transactions for millions of people around the world already exists, successfully, with Bitcoin.

A decentralized financial system, with the option to share data with interested parties, is a confident first step toward something resembling a universal basic income, without further mismanaging privacy or the tax code.

## The Modern Family
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 30, 2017


Steve Jobs had a simple vision: one day every family would own a personal computer. That vision came true. Today, most Western households own at least one desktop or laptop computer. Most also own an array of mobile pocket supercomputers, complete with high resolution graphics, sensing cameras, speech recognition; a virtual assistant; proximity, light and moisture sensors; a three-axis gyroscope, a barometer, and software with the response and reliability of any sophisticated modern machine.

While this does not come close to enumerating the specs of the iPhone, you get the point. We are far more tech savvy than we care to admit. The issue of late is how much our computer devices are savvy of us. I am specifically interested in the value they generate compared to the amount of real dollars we spend on them. The iPhone is an extraordinary device. Nonetheless, only the exceptionally tech savvy may build applications and make decent money with them.

I believe we have adopted a consumerist disposition to a creative medium. I question, why haven't these devices enhanced our ability to work less, buy less, and do more? Why are they not at a minimum generating a basic income for us to pay for their services, let alone our monthly debts and mortgages?

The question is equally sociological as economic. We were champion consumers throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The home appliances market exploded and many working-class families from around the world bought them. Most people prided themselves on how much stuff they owned. The internet's business model was bootstrapped with the same model that bootstrapped the television industry: advertising. Working-class families after a hard day's work discovered new products to purchase while being entertained by television programs. Sadly, the internet has become a shopping and entertainment portal not dissimilar to the legacy television networks.

However, this might be a transient state. I believe we can be weaned off of consumption and suckled on the fruits of our own production. The end result may not only be an increase in wealth but a reduction in the non-creative work necessary to generate it. I am talking about a more modern system capable of storing incorruptible monetary value whose currency is capable of instant machine-to-machine payments. You know where this is going.

Just as nearly every working-class home over the last 20 years has purchased some form of internet-connected computer, I believe every home over the next 20 years should be a participant in a global financial system. In the 20 years since Jobs returned to Apple (1997) with a vision for how to rebuild a company on the brink of bankruptcy, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system emerged to do the same for the working-class family. Modems, routers and smartphones, were the first wave yet required the advertising model to fund its creative outlet: the internet. Miners, routers ([Lightning Network](https://lightning.network){:target="_blank"} nodes on [Bitcoin Fibre](http://bitcoinfibre.org){:target="_blank"}) and Bitcoin wallets may be required to migrate the working-class family from consumers to shareholder.

## Personal Responsibility
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 29, 2017


As we migrate from consumer to equal partner in our new global financial system, there are some best practices you should be acquainted with going forward. First, never keep your bitcoins or any significant amount of fiat money (dollars, euros, yen, rubles, etc. ) on a cryptocurrency exchange. This is not because exchanges are unethical or incompetent. While this is certainly relevant to some exchanges these aren't the early days of Mt. Gox. Exchanges and what the community expects of them has dramatically improved. It is because exchanges are first and foremost centralized, and therefore easier to attack, litigate, or hold hostage.

Second, because Bitcoin is not about trusted third-parties managing your cryptocurrency. Your interface to Bitcoin so far has likely been through a third-party service, perhaps even one that holds the private keys to your coins. This is highly inadvisable. Letting someone else control your private keys means they say when and how you have access to your bitcoins.

Unfortunately this is common and obscures the reason why Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin's system of exchange (what inventor Satoshi Nakamoto called a "proof-of-work chain," also known as "blockchain,") is designed to be peer-to-peer, meaning between you and another person (or machine). Your interface to Bitcoin would be better understood with someone sending you bitcoins directly to a wallet where you own and control the private keys. I will discuss more of this and other best practices in later posts.

For now, if you do not have an approved Bitcoin wallet (one whose codebase is open source and may be peer reviewed, battle-tested and compared), check out [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet){:target="_blank"} for recommended desktop, hardware and software wallets. I personally prefer Bitcoin Core (desktop), Digital Bitbox for my hardware wallet, and Green Address and BitGo for mobile.

However, you should choose what best serves your needs. Maybe it's Ledger Nano S for your hardware wallet and Mycelium for your software wallet. Regardless, all of these give you ownership of your private keys. Purchasing bitcoins from an exchange like Gemini is fine, though [more private options exist](https://bisq.network){:target="_blank"}. Just make sure the moment you purchase bitcoins from Gemini, or any exchange, you immediately send them to a wallet where you control the private keys.

You are in control.

## On Antifragility
##### David Oliver Doswell

##### November 29, 2017


Systems as with people improve when they profit from information. But some information cannot be researched. One of life's annoying little lessons is that durable information may be only be acquired through experience. For a citizenry crudely optimized for efficiency this is not a welcome development. The process is uncivilized, error prone, and reductionist. But this is how we learn to be efficient in the absence of fantasy: experimentation.

Bitcoin is a trust-minimized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that gains from disorder. As a singularity the system is more organism than state machine and evolves somewhat similarly. Information propagates through the network by way of unit tests and attacks, price discovery and speculation, until it is battle-tested with nothing more than pure nature to kill it or make it stronger.
