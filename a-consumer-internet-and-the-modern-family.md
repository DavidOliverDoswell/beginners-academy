## A Consumer Internet and The Modern Family

Steve Jobs had a simple vision: one day every family would own a personal computer. That vision came true. Today, most Western households own at least one desktop or laptop computer. Most also own an array of mobile pocket supercomputers, complete with high resolution graphics, sensing cameras, speech recognition; a virtual assistant; proximity, light and moisture sensors; a three-axis gyroscope, a barometer, and software with the response and reliability of any sophisticated modern machine.

While this does not come close to enumerating the specs of the iPhone, you get the point. We are far more tech savvy than we care to admit. The issue of late is how much our computer devices are savvy of us. I am specifically interested in the value they generate compared to the amount of real dollars we spend on them. The iPhone is an extraordinary device. Nonetheless, only the exceptionally tech savvy may build applications and make decent money with them.

I believe we have adopted a consumerist disposition to a creative medium. I question, why haven't these devices enhanced our ability to work less, buy less, and do more? Why are they not at a minimum generating a basic income for us to pay for their services, let alone our monthly debts and mortgages?

The question is equally sociological as economic. We were champion consumers throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The home appliances market exploded and many working-class families from around the world bought them. Most people prided themselves on how much stuff they owned. The internet's business model was bootstrapped with the same model that bootstrapped the television industry: advertising. Working-class families after a hard day's work discovered new products to purchase while being entertained by television programs. Sadly, the internet has become a shopping and entertainment portal not dissimilar to the legacy television networks.

However, this might be a transient state. I believe we can be weaned off of consumption and suckled on the fruits of our own production. The end result may not only be an increase in wealth but a reduction in the non-creative work necessary to generate it. I am talking about a more modern system capable of storing incorruptible monetary value whose currency is capable of instant machine-to-machine payments. You know where this is going.

Just as nearly every working-class home over the last 20 years has purchased some form of internet-connected computer, I believe every home over the next 20 years should be a participant in a global financial system. In the 20 years since Jobs returned to Apple (1997) with a vision for how to rebuild a company on the brink of bankruptcy, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system emerged to do the same for the working-class family. Modems, routers and smartphones, were the first wave yet required the advertising model to fund its creative outlet: the internet. Miners, routers ([Lightning Network](https://lightning.network){:target="_blank"} nodes on [Bitcoin Fibre](http://bitcoinfibre.org){:target="_blank"}) and Bitcoin wallets may be required to migrate the working-class family from consumers to shareholder.
