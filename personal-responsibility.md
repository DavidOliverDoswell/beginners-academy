## Personal Responsibility

As we migrate from consumer to equal partner in our new global financial system, there are some best practices you should be acquainted with going forward. First, never keep your bitcoins or any significant amount of fiat money (dollars, euros, yen, rubles, etc. ) on a cryptocurrency exchange. This is not because exchanges are unethical or incompetent. While this is certainly relevant to some exchanges these aren't the early days of Mt. Gox. Exchanges and what the community expects of them has dramatically improved. It is because exchanges are first and foremost centralized, and therefore easier to attack, litigate, or hold hostage.

Second, because Bitcoin is not about trusted third-parties managing your cryptocurrency. Your interface to Bitcoin so far has likely been through a third-party service, perhaps even one that holds the private keys to your coins. This is highly inadvisable. Letting someone else control your private keys means they say when and how you have access to your bitcoins.

Unfortunately this is common and obscures the reason why Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin's system of exchange (what inventor Satoshi Nakamoto called a "proof-of-work chain," also known as "blockchain,") is designed to be peer-to-peer, meaning between you and another person (or machine). Your interface to Bitcoin would be better understood with someone sending you bitcoins directly to a wallet where you own and control the private keys. I will discuss more of this and other best practices in later posts.

For now, if you do not have an approved Bitcoin wallet (one whose codebase is open source and may be peer reviewed, battle-tested and compared), check out [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet){:target="_blank"} for recommended desktop, hardware and software wallets. I personally prefer Bitcoin Core (desktop), Digital Bitbox for my hardware wallet, and Green Address and BitGo for mobile.

However, you should choose what best serves your needs. Maybe it's Ledger Nano S for your hardware wallet and Mycelium for your software wallet. Regardless, all of these give you ownership of your private keys. Purchasing bitcoins from an exchange like Gemini is fine, though [more private options exist](https://bisq.network){:target="_blank"}. Just make sure the moment you purchase bitcoins from Gemini, or any exchange, you immediately send them to a wallet where you control the private keys.

You are in control.
