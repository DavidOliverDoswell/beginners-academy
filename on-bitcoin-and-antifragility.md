Systems as with people improve when they profit from information. But some information cannot be researched. One of life's annoying little lessons is that durable information may be only be acquired through experience. For a citizenry crudely optimized for efficiency this is not a welcome development. The process is uncivilized, error prone, and reductionist. But this is how we learn to be efficient in the absence of fantasy: experimentation.

Bitcoin is a trust-minimized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that gains from disorder. As a singularity the system is more organism than state machine and evolves somewhat similarly. Information propagates through the network by way of unit tests and attacks, price discovery and speculation, until it is battle-tested with nothing more than pure nature to kill it or make it stronger.
